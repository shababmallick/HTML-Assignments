Tag: A tag is a fundamental building block of HTML. It is used to define elements within an HTML document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as <tagname>. Tags are typically used in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag, to define an element. For example, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is the closing tag.

Element: An element consists of one or more tags and the content between those tags. It represents a structural or semantic component of a web page. Elements are the actual building blocks of web content. For example, in <p>This is a paragraph.</p>, the entire structure, including the opening <p> tag, the content "This is a paragraph," and the closing </p> tag, constitutes the <p> element, which defines a paragraph on the webpage. Elements can be nested within each other to create more complex structures.
